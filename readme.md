## What is Blackbox? 🚀
Blackbox is a simple Database written in c++ controlled by Socket.

## How to use Blackbox? ❓
Currently Blackbox is in early development and isn't ready for use. We will update it soon.

<h3>rough overview:</h3>

The database is controlled with commands separated by hyphens.
- **Commands:**
    - **"cdb"** - create database
    - **"ddb"** - delete database
    - **"cl"**  - create table
    - **"dl"**  - delete table
    - **"i"**   - insert key and value
    - **"g"**   - get value
    - **"rk"**  - remove key

We're gonna make a NPM package, PIP package and a CLI for Blackbox. Maybe there will be a Java package too. 
Maybe we're gonna make a manage website localhostet to control the database.
